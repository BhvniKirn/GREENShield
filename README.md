Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

GREENsheild is a computer vision project designed to detect plant diseases using deep learning models trained on the PlantVillage dataset. The system classifies various plant diseases from leaf images and provides visual explanations through Grad-CAM.

## Features
- Plant disease classification using:
  - âœ… EfficientNet-B0
  - âœ… ResNet-50
- High test accuracy (~95%)
- Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability
- Google Colab-compatible code
- Model weights and dataset accessible via shared Google Drive

## Dataset
We used the **PlantVillage dataset** from Kaggle. It includes 50,000+ labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
